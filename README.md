  custom data fields for the proposal activity that helps track information
  about the grant.

  fields to help track foundations. 

You are welcome to disable and/or add fields to the group of custom data fields
installed by this extension.

Warning: If you install this extension, add data to the custom fields created,
and then uninstall this extension, it will delete the data you added to the
custom fields.
